# 🎓 Student Enrollment & Conversion Funnel Analysis (EdTech Case Study)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student behavior on an EdTech platform to understand **how users discover the platform, interact with courses, and convert into enrolled students**.  
The goal is to identify **drop-off points in the user funnel**, evaluate **marketing awareness channels**, and generate **data-driven recommendations** to improve enrollment and engagement.

This analysis simulates a real-world EdTech business scenario similar to platforms like Learntricks.

Note: The dataset used in this project is simulated to reflect realistic EdTech user behavior patterns and is created solely for analytical demonstration purposes.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the **student conversion funnel** from website visit to enrollment
- Identify stages where users **drop off without purchasing**
- Evaluate the effectiveness of **awareness and marketing channels**
- Generate actionable insights to improve **conversion rate and retention**
- Build a **dashboard-ready dataset** for business reporting

- 🧾 Dataset Description

The dataset represents anonymized user interaction data on an EdTech platform.

Key features include:

User visit status

Course page views

Pricing page views

Enrollment status

Awareness source (Social Media, Ads, Referrals, Organic Search)

Time spent on platform

Device type

Dataset is simulated to reflect realistic EdTech user behavior patterns.


🔍 Analysis Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Funnel stage analysis

Awareness channel effectiveness analysis

Drop-off and conversion rate calculation

Summary metric creation for dashboarding

📊 Key Insights

A significant number of users visit the platform but drop off at the pricing stage

Users coming through referrals and organic search show higher conversion rates

Paid ads generate high traffic but lower enrollment efficiency

Most drop-offs occur due to price sensitivity and lack of early engagement

Returning users are more likely to convert than first-time visitors

📈 Awareness & Marketing Effectiveness

The analysis includes a dedicated section on how users become aware of the platform:

Compared performance of Social Media, Ads, Referrals, and Organic Search

Identified which channels bring high-quality leads

Suggested focus on content-driven organic traffic and referral programs

This section helps answer:

“Are we spending marketing budget on the right channels?”

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Jupyter Notebook

Power BI

Excel

EDA & Data Visualization techniques

💡 Business Recommendations

Optimize pricing page UX to reduce drop-offs

Strengthen referral-based marketing strategies

Improve onboarding experience for first-time users

Use funnel metrics to guide marketing spend allocation

Track returning user behavior separately for retention strategies

🚀 Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to:

Translate raw data into meaningful business insights

Understand user behavior through funnel analysis

Support decision-making with clear visualizations and metrics

Work on real-world EdTech-style analytical problems
